# DesignNotes

Performance requirements
Requirements about resources required, response time, transaction rates, throughput, benchmark specifications or anything else having to do with performance.

Reliability
Requirements about how often the software fails. The measurement is often expressed in MTBF (mean time between failures). The definition of a failure must be clear. Also, don't confuse reliability with availability which is quite a different kind of requirement.  Be sure to specify the consequences of software failure, how to protect from failure, a strategy for error detection, and a strategy for correction.
